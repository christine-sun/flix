Please list two areas of the assignment you'd like to **discuss further with your peers** during the next class (examples include better ways to implement something, how to extend your app in certain ways, etc):

1. Which layout for the movies do you think users generally prefer? Why?
2. How do you think one could incorporate social elements into this application?

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

I encountered an issue with the image sizing in the Collection View. To resolve this, I had to manually adjust the values of the width and height. Upon conferring with the TAs, it seems that auto-layout will make this process much more smooth in the future.
